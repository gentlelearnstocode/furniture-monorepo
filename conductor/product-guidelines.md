# Product Guidelines: ThienAn Furniture Monorepo

## Communication Tone
- **Professional & Elegant:** The platform's copy should be sophisticated and trustworthy, mirroring the high-quality and premium nature of the furniture. Avoid overly casual language in favor of a polished, authoritative voice.

## Technical Specifications
- **Concise & Direct:** Product details and technical specifications must be presented clearly and efficiently. Use structured formats like bulleted lists and tables to allow users to quickly find essential information without wading through dense paragraphs.

## Call to Action (CTA) Strategy
- **Subtle & Guiding:** CTAs should focus on guiding the user through a journey of discovery. Use language that encourages exploration (e.g., "Discover the Collection", "Explore the Details") rather than high-pressure sales tactics, maintaining a premium brand experience.

## Accessibility & Inclusivity
- **Compliance-First:** Accessibility is a core requirement. Development must strictly adhere to WCAG standards (e.g., semantic HTML, proper contrast, keyboard navigability) to ensure the platform is inclusive and usable for all individuals.

## Error Handling & Feedback
- **Helpful & Instructive:** When errors occur or feedback is required, the system must provide clear, jargon-free explanations of the situation and, most importantly, provide direct, actionable steps for the user to resolve the issue or proceed.
